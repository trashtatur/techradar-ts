# techradar-ts
Wrapper around the Zalando techradar implementation in typescript, to provide typesupport and validation.
The library is hard to understand properly without types already, so I wanted to make it a little easier for you all out there
to wrangle it into shape.

I tried my best to get the types right. If any of them are not however, do make a Pull Request, or open an issue on github


## Install
```
npm i techradar-ts
```
Nothing else needs to be done

## Usage
Just import things like this and use them

```ts
import { createEntry } from 'techradar-ts'
```
